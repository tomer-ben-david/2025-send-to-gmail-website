You're working on something. You have a file you need to upload, compress, or analyze. Or a block of text you want explained.

The normal workflow: open a browser tab, navigate to a service, find the file, upload it, wait, repeat. Five minutes gone for a 10-second task.

QuiKey fixes this. Right-click any file or selected text, pick an action, done.

## What QuiKey Actually Does

QuiKey is a macOS app that adds your most-used actions directly to the right-click menu. In Finder, you can:

- **Upload to Google Drive** — Send files to Drive from Finder, with folder selection
- **Analyze with AI** — Send files to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude for analysis
- **Convert to PDF** — Convert documents and images without leaving Finder
- **Compress video** — Reduce video and GIF size for easier sharing

It also works with selected text in any app. Right-click selected text and you can:

- Analyze, translate, define, summarize, explain, or grammar-check
- Choose ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude for the response

The key thing: you never leave what you're doing. No app switching. No browser tabs. No interruption to your flow.

## Setting It Up

Download QuiKey and open it. The first thing you'll see is a setup wizard that walks you through:

1. **Google sign-in** — Required for Google Drive uploads
2. **AI setup** — Provide API keys, use browser mode, or use Claude CLI subscription mode
3. **macOS permissions** — Enable QuiKey services in System Settings

That last step is important. macOS requires explicit permission for apps to add items to the right-click menu. QuiKey guides you there, but the path is:

System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Services

Once that's done, you're set.

## Uploading to Google Drive

Right-click any file (or multiple files) and select **Upload to Drive**.

You can configure:
- A default folder (so files always go to the same place)
- Whether to show a dialog to pick the folder each time
- Optional comments on the uploaded file

The dialog shows you a folder tree so you can navigate your Drive structure. This is faster than opening Drive in a browser and dragging files around.

## Analyzing Files with AI

Right-click a file, pick **Analyze with ChatGPT**, **Analyze with Gemini**, or **Analyze with Claude**. A dialog opens asking what you want to know about the file.

Use cases that work well:
- **PDFs**: "Summarize this contract" or "What are the key dates?"
- **Images**: "What's in this screenshot?" or "Extract the text"
- **Code files**: "Explain what this function does" or "Find bugs"
- **Spreadsheets**: "What trends do you see in this data?"

The AI sees the actual file contents, not just the filename. So it can give meaningful answers.

You can choose between:
- **Browser mode** (uses your web session where supported)
- **API mode** (uses your API key directly)
- **Claude CLI mode** (if you have a Claude CLI subscription)

API mode is typically faster and more reliable for frequent use.

## Convert to PDF and Compress Video

These are the zero-friction utilities:

- **Convert to PDF**: convert images and documents instantly, with merge options and quality settings.
- **Compress video**: shrink large video files and GIFs for faster sharing.

Both actions run from Finder right-click and complete with a system notification.

## Text Selection Services

Select any text in any app. Right-click. You'll see QuiKey's text services:

- **Analyze** — General "what is this?"
- **Translate** — Translate to your configured language
- **Define** — Dictionary-style definitions
- **Summarize** — Condense long text
- **Explain** — Simplify complex text
- **Grammar Check** — Fix writing errors

Each action opens a small dialog with the AI's response. You can copy the result or continue the conversation.

## AI Chats and AI Squads

Inside the app, you also get:

- **AI Chats** — Ongoing conversations with files, follow-ups, and local history
- **AI Squads** — Multi-step workflows where multiple providers collaborate on one output
- **OpenRouter models** — Access a large catalog of models for chats and squads

If you want a single place to run complex AI workflows on your files, this is it.

## History and Statistics

The History tab shows what you ran and when. You can reopen past AI conversations and filter by provider. The Statistics tab shows usage summaries over time.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of It

- **Start with what you do often.** Set a default Drive folder if you upload frequently.
- **Use the menu bar icon.** Quick access to the main window and drag-and-drop.
- **Prefer API mode for reliability.** Browser automation can break when sites change.
- **Check History.** It's the fastest way to reopen a past AI conversation.
