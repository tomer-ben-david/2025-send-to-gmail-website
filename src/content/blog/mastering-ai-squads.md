Single-agent AI is great for simple questions. But for complex work—researching a niche topic, drafting a technical spec, or making a high-stakes decision—one model isn't enough. You need second opinions, critique, and synthesis.

That's why we built **AI Squads**. 

Instead of treating AI as a single chat box, QuiKey lets you orchestrate a "squad" of different models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and more) to work together on a single task. It's the difference between asking one person for a summary and having a whole team of experts provide a comprehensive report.

Here’s how to master your first Squad.

### 1. The Unified Entry: Prompt-to-Workflow
You don't need to be a "prompt engineer" to use Squads. With **Unified Entry**, you just type what you want. 

Want a deep dive on a new technology? Just type: *"Research the state of solid-state batteries in 2025, compare current breakthroughs, and consolidate into a briefing for investors."*

QuiKey analyzes your prompt and automatically builds a multi-step plan. It might start with a parallel research phase using three different models, follow up with a synthesis phase, and end with a polishing phase.

### 2. Checkpoint Gating: Stay in Control
The biggest fear with "agentic" AI is that it goes off the rails or burns through your budget on a hallucination. 

QuiKey solves this with **Checkpoint Gating**. By default, Squads pause at critical moments in the workflow. You see exactly what each model has produced *so far*. You can:
- **Approve**: "This looks great, keep going."
- **Steer**: "Focus more on the safety aspects in the next step."
- **Pick the Winner**: If three models give different answers, you select the best one to be used in the next phase.

It’s human-in-the-loop AI that actually works.

### 3. Divergence Detection
When you run models in parallel—like a "Decision Council" to weigh the pros and cons of a business move—QuiKey looks for **Divergence**. 

If Claude 3.5 thinks a strategy is low-risk but GPT-4o flags it as high-risk, QuiKey will explicitly highlight this disagreement. We call this "Semantic Triggers." Instead of hiding the differences, we surface them so you can make an informed decision.

### 4. The Artifacts Viewer
Squads often produce multiple files or complex documents. Instead of hunting through chat history, use the **Artifacts Viewer**. It’s a dedicated drawer that collects every draft, research note, and final output created during the session. One-click and it's in your Finder or your Gmail.

### 5. Essential Squad Templates
To get you started, we’ve included several proven workflow templates:

- **Decision Council**: Get simultaneous perspectives from Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini on a single problem. Ideal for "Second Opinion" moments.
- **Spec Workshop**: Parallel drafting followed by automated consolidation and a final round of critique/polishing. Perfect for PRDs and technical docs.
- **Deep Research**: Broad-scale information gathering where results are synthesized into a single cohesive summary.
- **Creative Studio**: A multi-model cycle of drafting, harsh critique, and refinement to get the best possible prose.

### The Power User Tip: Follow-up Chats
A common mistake is thinking a Squad run is "finished" once the workflow stops. 

You can **chat with the entire history** of the Squad session. If the final report is't quite right, just type a follow-up prompt. The AI has the full context of the entire multi-step run and can refine the results instantly.

AI Squads turn your Mac into a command center for multi-model intelligence. It's not about which model is "best"—it's about how you orchestrate them to work for you.
