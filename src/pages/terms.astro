        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: {LAST_UPDATED}</p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of QuiKey (the “App”). By installing or using the App, you agree
          to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Permitted Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the App only for lawful purposes.</li>
          <li>Comply with the terms and policies of any third‑party service you use via the App.</li>
          <li>Not use the App to send spam, malware, or unlawful content.</li>
          <li>Keep your accounts, OAuth access, and API keys secure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>Depending on the actions you run, QuiKey may integrate with third parties including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google (Gmail, Drive, Gemini)</li>
          <li>OpenAI (ChatGPT)</li>
          <li>Anthropic (Claude)</li>
          <li>OpenRouter (model access/routing)</li>
          <li>CloudConvert (optional PDF conversion fallback)</li>
          <li>Lemon Squeezy (payments/licensing)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your use of those services is governed by their terms. We do not control them and are not responsible for their
          availability, pricing, policy changes, or outages.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Authentication, API Keys, and Local Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>OAuth tokens and API keys are stored locally on your Mac in encrypted form.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for obtaining, managing, and safeguarding your API keys and third‑party accounts.</li>
          <li>The App uses your keys/tokens only to communicate with the provider(s) you configure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Important Safety Notice (Backups and Data Loss)</h2>
        <p>
          The App interacts with files you select and system services you enable. While we aim to be safe and reliable:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for maintaining backups of your files and your system.</li>
          <li>
            Do not use the App in a way that would be unsafe if a file were modified, corrupted, deleted, or uploaded
            unexpectedly.
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that software can have bugs, and the App may malfunction due to your configuration, macOS
            updates, third‑party changes, or other causes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. AI Output Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          AI-generated output may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. Do not rely on AI output as professional
          advice (legal, medical, financial, security, etc.). You are responsible for verifying results before acting on
          them.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p class="all-caps">
          THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
          MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL
          BE ERROR‑FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="all-caps">
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (A) WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
          CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, FILES, PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS
          INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY; AND (B) OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE
          APP WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING
          RISE TO THE CLAIM OR (II) USD $50.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations. In that case, these limitations apply to the greatest
          extent permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including
          reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your content, or your violation of these Terms or
          third‑party terms.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate access to paid features (if applicable) if you violate these Terms. You may stop
          using the App at any time by uninstalling it.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the
          updated Terms.
        </p>
