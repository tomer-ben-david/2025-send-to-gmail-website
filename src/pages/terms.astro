        </ul>

        <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
        <p class="all-caps">
          THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE ERROR‑FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="all-caps">
          IN NO EVENT SHALL QUIKEY, ITS OWNERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, FILES, PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.
        </p>
        <p class="all-caps">
          THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION AND BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ONLY, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA (INCLUDING WHERE YOU FAILED TO MAINTAIN BACKUPS), DELETION OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT (GMAIL/DRIVE), LOSS OF ACCESS TO A DEVICE OR ACCOUNT, SYSTEM DAMAGE, DOWNTIME, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER.
        </p>
        <p class="all-caps">
          THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        </p>
        <p class="all-caps">
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE APPLICATION SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APPLICATION IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR (B) $50 USD (OR THE EQUIVALENT IN THE CURRENCY WHERE THE CLAIM IS BROUGHT, CALCULATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE DATE OF THE CLAIM).
        </p>

        <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:
          (a) your use of the application;
          (b) content you create, send, or process through the application;
          (c) your violation of these terms or any third-party terms;
          (d) your API keys being compromised or misused; or
          (e) claims by third parties (including Google, AI providers, or email recipients) related to your use of the application.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>(a) General:</strong> These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to conflict of law principles.
          Any disputes must be resolved exclusively in the competent courts of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(b) Mandatory Consumer Rights:</strong> If you are a consumer (i.e., not using the application for business purposes) residing in the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, or any other jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws that cannot be waived by contract, those laws govern to the extent they provide greater protections than these terms. In case of conflict, the mandatory local law controls as to those specific protections only; all other provisions of these terms remain in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(c) Class Action Waiver:</strong> You agree to resolve disputes individually and waive any right to bring or participate in class actions, collective proceedings, or representative actions, except where prohibited by law.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to paid features or services (if applicable) if you violate these terms or applicable law.
          You may stop using the application at any time by uninstalling it. Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The application may collect anonymized usage statistics and crash reports if enabled in Settings. For details, see the
          <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify these terms at any time by posting updated terms on our website and/or within the application. We may notify you of
          material changes via the application. Your continued use after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance. If you do not
          agree to changes, you must stop using the application.
        </p>
